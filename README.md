## Summary: 
For the GP@100 website, we are creating a map of where all Mines Geophysics almuni are currently living. We will also be utilizing data analysis to describe and understand the data.
## Background info:
We are interested in understanding patterns in where alumni take residence following graduation from the Mines Department of Geophysics.

Additionally, we are interested in understanding whether the level of degree obtained has additional influence in post-grad residence.
## Objective:
Create a comprehensive map of the current residence of Mines Geophysics alumni.
## Datasets:
Anonymous records of Department of Geophysics alumni current residence and level of degree obtained.
## Tools/packages: 
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
## Planned methodology/approach:
- Compile alumn by filtering by state.
- Split the compiled state data by level of degree obtained.
- Plot data filtered by state.
- etc.
## Expected outcomes:
## Any other relevant information, images/tables, references, etc.:
