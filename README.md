## Summary: 
For the GP@100 website, we are creating a map of where all Mines Geophysics almuni are currently living. We will also be utilizing data analysis to describe and understand the data.
## Background info:
We are interested in understanding patterns in where alumni take residence following graduation from the Mines Department of Geophysics.

Additionally, we are interested in understanding whether the level of degree obtained has additional influence in post-grad residence.
## Objective:
Create a comprehensive map of the current residence of Mines Geophysics alumni.
## Datasets:
Anonymous records of Department of Geophysics alumni current residence and level of degree obtained.

[GP Alumni List](https://github.com/GPGN-268/SP2024-FP04-alumni-map/blob/6131c6380ba5bcbf34a334e886e667b6c3157e90/data/GP_Alumni_List.csv)
## Tools/packages: 
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
## Planned methodology/approach:
- Compile alumni by filtering by state.
- Split the compiled state data by level of degree obtained.
- Plot data filtered by state.
- etc.
## Present/Anticipated Challenges:
- Transferring data to a visually representative form (map).
## Expected outcomes:
As an outcome of this project, we expect to produce a comprehensive map plotting the residency of Mines alumnni from the Department of Geophysics.

This information will be useful as a promotional tool for the geophysics program at Mines.
## Any other relevant information, images/tables, references, etc.:
To respect the privacy and anonymity of alumni, the plotting of residency will be detailed no further than state and level of degree obtained for each alumn.
